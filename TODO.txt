This project requires you to build a client server application. The client is a Python based console application. Please build the client by using Python Prompt Toolkit (https://python-prompt-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/master/) or similar libraray. The server is a Flask based service. To support websock communication, you could use https://pypi.org/project/websocket-client/ and https://flask-socketio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. 

Main features required are:
* Support websocket session and two ways communications
* Support message pushing from server to multiple clients
* Support message broadcasting
* Support authentication (Flask-Login or similar)
* Support Cross-Origin Controls

A successful delivery should include:
* Full working code base
* Unit Tests
* Packaging and distribution to allow client and server being installed separated by using pip command
* Readme.md
